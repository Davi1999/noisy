## A Platform for Music Lovers
This is an experimental web application I am making to teach myself how to use Express.js and get better at using React.
The overall concept is that it will be a social media/community application for people interested in music and music discovery through community features.
Each user will have a profile with an interactive page which contains their favorite, genres, artists, and albums.
There will be pages for genres, albums and artists where users can discuss their favorite songs, pop culture moments, etc...
It isn't meant to be some huge platform with millions of users. Just an experiment.
