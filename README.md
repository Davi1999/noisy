## A Platform for Music Lovers
This is an experimental web application I am making to teach myself how to use Express.js and get better at using React.
The overall concept is that it will be a social media/community application for people interested in music and music discovery through community features.
Each user will have a profile with an interactive page which contains their favorite, genres, artists, and albums.
There will be pages for genres, albums and artists where users can discuss their favorite songs, pop culture moments, etc...
It isn't meant to be some huge platform with millions of users. Just an experiment.

## Planning
This area will be for general structure and feature planning.
### Tech Stack
We will be using JavaScript for front and back end, with React as the frontend framework and Express.js as the backend framework.
Still trying to decide on the database. Right now I'm between:
- MySQL
- PostgresSQL
- MongoDB
