## A Platform for Music Lovers
This is an experimental web application I am making to teach myself how to use Express.js and get better at using React.
The overall concept is that it will be a social media/community application for people interested in music and music discovery through community features.
Each user will have a profile with an interactive page which contains their favorite, genres, artists, and albums.
There will be pages for genres, albums and artists where users can discuss their favorite songs, pop culture moments, etc...
It isn't meant to be some huge platform with millions of users. Just an experiment.

## Planning
This area will be for general structure and feature planning.
### Tech Stack
This section will list the current and planned technologies and tools involved in the project.
#### Front-End Structure
- JavaScript
- React
- Bootstrap
  
#### Back-End Structure
- JavaScript
- Express.js

#### Database
I still haven't decided on a database yet.
Database Options:
- MySQL
- PostgresSQL
- MongoDB

#### Deployment
I want to host the project on the cloud somewhere, this decision may affect my database implementation as well. So figuring this out should be priority.
Cloud hosting options:
- AWS
- GCP
- Azure
- IBM
- Oracle
  
I will compare prices and features to determine the best fit for the project. Since I just want this to be a small project for displaying my technical abilities and not a widespread service, ideally, the hosting will be free.
