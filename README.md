# noisy
## A Platform for Music Lovers
This is an experimental web application I am making to teach myself how to use Express.js and get better at using React.
The overall concept is that it will be a social media/community application for people interested in music and music discovery through community features.
Each user will have a profile with an interactive page which contains their favorite, genres, artists, and albums.
There will be pages for genres, albums and artists where users can discuss their favorite songs, pop culture moments, etc...
It isn't meant to be some huge platform with millions of users. Just an experiment.

## Planning
This area will be for general structure and feature planning.
### Tech Stack
This section will list the current and planned technologies and tools involved in the project.
#### Front-End Structure
- JavaScript
- React
- Bootstrap
  
#### Back-End Structure
- JavaScript
- Express.js

#### Database
I still haven't decided on a database yet.
Database Options:
- MySQL
- PostgresSQL
- MongoDB

#### Music Content
I need to figure out how I will generate music content for users to access. We need a database of albums, artists and genres.
I know that I want to connect APIs for users to access the music they add to noisy and have the ability to access them on:
- Spotify
- Apple Music

I'm just not sure about how I will implement the content which will be hosted on the platform.

#### Deployment
I want to host the project on the cloud somewhere, this decision may affect my database implementation as well. So figuring this out should be priority.
Cloud hosting options:
- AWS
- GCP
- Azure
- IBM
- Oracle
  
I will compare prices and features to determine the best fit for the project. Since I just want this to be a small project for displaying my technical abilities and not a widespread service, ideally, the hosting will be free.

### TODO
A list of tasks needed to be completed, in order of most important to least (Still Under construction):
1. Figure out deployment/cloud hosting
2. Figure out music content connection
3. Configure Database
    - Music (Artists, Albums, Genres)
    - Users (usernames, passwords, content)
    - User interactions (friends, likes, comments)
    - more...
5. Set up user authentication
6. Set up user interactions
7. more...
